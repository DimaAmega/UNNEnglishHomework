<h2 id="exercise-10-page-11-having-friends-who-do-the-same-job-as-you">Exercise 10. Page 11. Having friends who do the same job as you.</h2>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction:</h3>
<p>We spend a significant part of our lives at work. At the same time, it's important that we are surrounded by people with whom we are comfortable and pleasant to interact. And it would seem that the best scenario is when these people are our friends. But not all so simple.</p>
<h3 id="main-part">Main Part:</h3>
<p>It seems logical that working with friends is the best option. But practice shows that this often leads to conflicts. This is due to the confusion of personal and professional relationships. If you think about it, it becomes abundantly clear that there are many mutually exclusive things in these two areas of our life. Here's a simple example. With friends, we often want to just relax, talk about something, but at work we need you and your friends to work. Note that I am not even talking about a situation where your friend is your boss, or vice versa. This further complicates the situation. Of course, I am not saying that this is always the case, there are exceptions.</p>
<p>If you and your friends don't work for the same company, then that makes a big difference. You can talk about work aspects as well as about anything else. And in my opinion it's just great! This is how I try to build my friendships. Moreover, if you work on similar jobs, this means that you look at many things the same way and your interests coincide in many ways. It is very important for friends to have common points of contact.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion:</h3>
<p>I think it's great to have friends who work in the same job as you! But only if you work in different jobs.</p>
<h2 id="exercise-6-page-7">Exercise 6. Page 7.</h2>
<p>I will tell you about Italy, although I was not there, there was my friend,  who was deeply impressed by this country and told me its lifestyle. My friend got the impression that neither money, nor career, nor politics are as important to an Italian as enjoying their leisure time. Largely, delicious food, good wine, chatting with friends, family vacations, these things are of paramount importance and give meaning to life. Hence the popular belief that the average Italian is lazy and just likes to have fun. Italians are cheerful. They are very inquisitive and show tremendous interest in other people's customs. Italians often go on vacation abroad - then to once again make sure that their own country is the best in the world, because Italy has everything you need for a beautiful life: sun, sea, food, wine. I think, if I want to relax in another country, I will definitely go to the italy!</p>
<p>As for my lifestyle. I can say that I absolutely don't know how to rest. Well, often, when I take a break, I think that I could spend this time more useful, at work or studying. There is another important point that I found in myself. Every time, then i start to working on something, i try my best for better result. I feel that it's very difficult for me to get the job done at an average level. Also It has been important for me to develop comprehensively, so I constantly try to do something new. So, this is my lifestyle and I like people with a similar lifestyle.</p>
<h2 id="relationship-of-a-famous-or-not-so-famous-couple-using-expressions-from-exercise-5-page-15">Relationship of a famous or not-so-famous couple. Using expressions from exercise 5. Page 15.</h2>
<p>I want to tell you about a couple from the movie &quot;Flipped&quot;. Before reading the text, <a href="https://www.kinopoisk.ru/film/470037/buy/books/">watch</a> the movie, it's worth it. Spoilers follow. Be careful!</p>
<p>The film follows the relationship between two teenagers, Bryce Loski and Julie Baker. They came across for the first time in childhood, from that moment Julie fell in love with Bryce. Bryce tried in every possible way to split up any relationships from Julie, because he believed that she was acting very weird. Julie thought that this period will soon get over and everything will be all right. But there was the incident. Bryce had been throwing out the eggs that Julie gave to his family for several weeks, but then Julie found out about it. Of course, they fell out.
From that moment, they seemed to have changed places (Flipped): Bryce suddenly began to feel feelings for Julie, and on the contrary, she began to consider Bryce the most ordinary guy. After some time, Bryce decides to plant a tree in Julie's garden, this act greatly influenced Julie and she was able to forgive him. And they got together!</p>

<p>Raising children is a very important social function of the family. It's important to be clear about what your child is allowed to do and what is not. These rules form the basis for raising a child.</p>
<h3 id="personally-i-have-compiled-the-following-list-of-rules">Personally, I have compiled the following list of rules:</h3>
<ul>
<li>About education. I think it's important to study all our life. As for choosing what to study. From parent's side, it is important to show what directions exist and allow the child to choose it for himself. There should be no pressure and imposition of another choice.</li>
<li>About food. What we eat affects our well-being and overall health quite dramatically. It is important to try to eat healthy foods and explain this to your child from an early age. But, nevertheless, I understand how difficult it is to follow a healthy diet. Overall, the child should chouse what to eat by himself, but and the explanation of the consequences is on the side of the parent.</li>
<li>What was said above also applies to bed times.</li>
<li>About school. The child should go to the school. Not so much for gaining knowledge as for communication. It is very important to lay the foundations for healthy peer communication.</li>
<li>About free time. The child should have enough free time to play games with friends and just to relax. And he should be able to independently choose how to spend his free time. I know of cases when parents forced their child to do too many things, which took up all his free time. For parent's side i wouldn't do that for sure.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion-1">Conclusion:</h3>
<p>All these rules are based on the fact that the child should independently make decisions without any pressure from the parents and be personally responsible for their actions.</p>

<h2 id="about-humour">About Humour</h2>
<p><code>Information taken from open sources</code></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Humor in Japan.</p>
<p>At first glance, it may seem that the Japanese have no sense of humor at all, neither in everyday life, nor, even more so, in a business setting. In fact, the Japanese adore humor so much that they elevated the ability to joke to the rank of art, which is called rakugo. This is a kind of one-man storytelling theater. The main thing in such stories is the subtext that causes laughter among the local public, and sometimes foreigners can be confused.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Humor in Italy</p>
<p>Many people know that Italians have a great sense of humor, but not everyone knows about their contribution to the development of modern comic genres. Meanwhile, it was in Italy that the foundations of &quot;stand up&quot; were laid. Today, Italians are ready to joke about anything except the family. Most often, their humor is directed at themselves, politicians and neighbors from other regions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I deliberately took two countries with rather different points of view on humor. Below I will tell you a little about the different types of humor that i realy like.</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Puns&quot; are a kind of humor that is present in one way or another in all countries. The essence of a pun is a word combination containing a pun based on the use of words that sound the same, but differ in meaning or have different meanings of the same word. For example: - How can food upset you? - If this is a funeral meal. The word &quot;mourning&quot; there sounds almost like &quot;morning&quot;. So easy and fun!</li>
<li>Self-irony is irony directed against oneself. In self-irony, negative statements can have the opposite (positive) connotation. On example: &quot;Laughing at yourself is easier, but not better&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="about-city">About City</h2>
<p>I recently watched a <a href="https://youtu.be/Gb0TQ7VeApY">YouTube</a> video about Japan and it really amazed me! After that I definitely want to visit the capital of Japan - Tokyo. In general, everything that I will tell about the city applies not only to it but to the whole country. The Japanese are very avid dandies. There are a lot of expensive boutiques in the city.Of course, all global brands are represented here.
Twice in modern history, the metropolis remained in ruins: first during the Great Kantian earthquake of 1923, and then after large-scale firefighting during the Second World War. Because of this, the modern cityscape of Tokyo is mostly modern architecture.
The culture and mentality of the Japanese was greatly influenced by the isolated territorial position of the country, geographical and climatic features, as well as special natural phenomena (frequent earthquakes and typhoons), which was expressed in the peculiar attitude of the Japanese towards nature as a living creature. The Japanese appreciate nature and are able to admire her beauty. Also, the Japanese are very fond of animals. The infrastructure of pets is very developed. There are even hotels for cats and dogs, wow, really interesting!</p>
<p>I can tell a lot more about Tokyo, but it's better to see it all once than hear it.</p>
<h2 id="exercise-9-page-25-about-job">Exercise 9. Page 25. About job</h2>
<p>From childhood I was very exited by exact sciences, especially mathematics and physics. At school, I tried my best in these disciplines to get into a good university.
Due to my good studies at the University, I was invited to work at the Department of Control Theory and System Dynamics, there my supervisor and I wrote a few good science articles.
But at the same time, I have always been attracted to Web development. It attracted me because most of the services that we use every day work through the Internet and I always wanted to understand how it works. Moreover, in the modern world, it is more reasonable to make a Web application, because it is initially cross-platform, you do not need to download and install app, just click on the link, it is very convenient. Even this homework I did using my knowledge in web development!
Well. I really like it and I spent a lot of time creating some of my own projects, understanding existing web technologies. <a href="https://dimaamega.github.io/vectorfields/?x_str=y&amp;y_str=-L*y-x&amp;xspeed=5&amp;count=1350&amp;M_Time_Alive_particle=1.5&amp;M_n_lines=12&amp;L=1.99">Here</a> is an example of one of my projects dedicated to the study of differential equations.
In the middle of my 4th year at university, I applied for a job at an foreign web development company and my application was accepted.
Currently, i'm engaged backend development for several projects, which is just great! Recently we launched a <a href="https://ommiebird.com/">new social network</a>, on which my colleagues and i have been working for a long time.
I would like to note the fact that the knowledge obtained at the university is practically not useful to me in my work, but because of the university I have learned how to study effectively. This skill is useful in any job, especially in the information technologies.</p>
<h2 id="page-25-about-job">Exercise 7. Page 21. Planning a trip</h2>
<p>
    I would like to visit <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBJyaIR1mlw">iceland</a> because the nature is very beautiful there. 
    Iceland is an island nation in the North Atlantic Ocean. 
    I would like to taste all national dishes. Why not?) 
    An interesting fact is that the national cuisine there mostly includes of seafood, this is due to the fact that the entire island is surrounded by water. 
    In order to travel in Iceland, you don't need to plan a route in advance. 
    All because you don't have to go far to enjoy the beauty of nature. 
    But there are some interesting natural sites that are definitely worth a visit - these are the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wb84vvYSPEU&t=2092s">"black beach"</a> and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wb84vvYSPEU&t=2213s">"glacial lagoon"</a>. 
    And yet, I think it would be most convenient to rent a car. 
    There are many beautiful places and little time. Also, an interesting natural site is the "Faroe Islands". 
    It is an archipelago of 18 islands. The population of the Faroe Islands is only 50 thousand people. 
    Interesting fact about the Faroe Islands - houses with grass on the roof. That's very beautiful. 
    Several Yet. 
    There are no trees here, and there are twice as many sheep as people.
