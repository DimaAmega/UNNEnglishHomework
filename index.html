      Exercise 10. Page 11. Having friends who do the same job as you.
    </h2>
    <h3 id="introduction">Introduction:</h3>
    <p>
      We spend a significant part of our lives at work. At the same time, it's
      important that we are surrounded by people with whom we are comfortable
      and pleasant to interact. And it would seem that the best scenario is when
      these people are our friends. But not all so simple.
    </p>
    <h3 id="main-part">Main Part:</h3>
    <p>
      It seems logical that working with friends is the best option. But
      practice shows that this often leads to conflicts. This is due to the
      confusion of personal and professional relationships. If you think about
      it, it becomes abundantly clear that there are many mutually exclusive
      things in these two areas of our life. Here's a simple example. With
      friends, we often want to just relax, talk about something, but at work we
      need you and your friends to work. Note that I am not even talking about a
      situation where your friend is your boss, or vice versa. This further
      complicates the situation. Of course, I am not saying that this is always
      the case, there are exceptions.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you and your friends don't work for the same company, then that makes a
      big difference. You can talk about work aspects as well as about anything
      else. And in my opinion it's just great! This is how I try to build my
      friendships. Moreover, if you work on similar jobs, this means that you
      look at many things the same way and your interests coincide in many ways.
      it's very important for friends to have common points of contact.
    </p>
    <h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion:</h3>
    <p>
      I think it's great to have friends who work in the same job as you! But
      only if you work in different jobs.
    </p>
    <h2 id="exercise-6-page-7">Exercise 6. Page 7.</h2>
    <p>
      I will tell you about Italy, although I was not there, there was my
      friend, who was deeply impressed by this country and told me its
      lifestyle. My friend got the impression that neither money, nor career,
      nor politics are as important to an Italian as enjoying their leisure
      time. Largely, delicious food, good wine, chatting with friends, family
      vacations, these things are of paramount importance and give meaning to
      life. Hence the popular belief that the average Italian is lazy and just
      likes to have fun. Italians are cheerful. They are very inquisitive and
      show tremendous interest in other people's customs. Italians often go on
      vacation abroad - then to once again make sure that their own country is
      the best in the world, because Italy has everything you need for a
      beautiful life: sun, sea, food, wine. I think, if I want to relax in
      another country, I will definitely go to the italy!
    </p>
    <p>
      As for my lifestyle. I can say that I absolutely don't know how to rest.
      Well, often, when I take a break, I think that I could spend this time
      more useful, at work or studying. There is another important point that I
      found in myself. Every time, then i start to working on something, i try
      my best for better result. I feel that it's very difficult for me to get
      the job done at an average level. Also It has been important for me to
      develop comprehensively, so I constantly try to do something new. So, this
      is my lifestyle and I like people with a similar lifestyle.

      Relationship of a famous or not-so-famous couple. Using expressions from

    <p>
      I want to tell you about a couple from the movie &quot;Flipped&quot;.
      Before reading the text,
      <a href="https://www.kinopoisk.ru/film/470037/buy/books/">watch</a> the
      movie, it's worth it. Spoilers follow. Be careful!
    </p>
    <p>
      The film follows the relationship between two teenagers, Bryce Loski and
      Julie Baker. They came across for the first time in childhood, from that
      moment Julie fell in love with Bryce. Bryce tried in every possible way to
      split up any relationships from Julie, because he believed that she was
      acting very weird. Julie thought that this period will soon get over and
      everything will be all right. But there was the incident. Bryce had been
      throwing out the eggs that Julie gave to his family for several weeks, but
      then Julie found out about it. Of course, they fell out. From that moment,
      they seemed to have changed places (Flipped): Bryce suddenly began to feel
      feelings for Julie, and on the contrary, she began to consider Bryce the
      most ordinary guy. After some time, Bryce decides to plant a tree in
      Julie's garden, this act greatly influenced Julie and she was able to
      forgive him. And they got together!

      Discuss the following question: What do you fell children should and
      shouldn't be allowed to do? Exercise 10. Page 17.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Raising children is a very important social function of the family. It's
      important to be clear about what your child is allowed to do and what is
      not. These rules form the basis for raising a child.
    </p>
    <h3 id="personally-i-have-compiled-the-following-list-of-rules">
      Personally, I have compiled the following list of rules:
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        About education. I think it's important to study all our life. As for
        choosing what to study. From parent's side, it's important to show what
        directions exist and allow the child to choose it for himself. There
        should be no pressure and imposition of another choice.
      </li>
      <li>
        About food. What we eat affects our well-being and overall health quite
        dramatically. it's important to try to eat healthy foods and explain
        this to your child from an early age. But, nevertheless, I understand
        how difficult it's to follow a healthy diet. Overall, the child should
        chouse what to eat by himself, but and the explanation of the
        consequences is on the side of the parent.
      </li>
      <li>What was said above also applies to bed times.</li>
      <li>
        About school. The child should go to the school. Not so much for gaining
        knowledge as for communication. it's very important to lay the
        foundations for healthy peer communication.
      </li>
      <li>
        About free time. The child should have enough free time to play games
        with friends and just to relax. And he should be able to independently
        choose how to spend his free time. I know of cases when parents forced
        their child to do too many things, which took up all his free time. For
        parent's side i wouldn't do that for sure.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="conclusion-1">Conclusion:</h3>
    <p>
      All these rules are based on the fact that the child should independently
      make decisions without any pressure from the parents and be personally
      responsible for their actions.

    <p><code>Information taken from open sources</code></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Humor in Japan.</p>
        <p>
          At first glance, it may seem that the Japanese have no sense of humor
          at all, neither in everyday life, nor, even more so, in a business
          setting. In fact, the Japanese adore humor so much that they elevated
          the ability to joke to the rank of art, which is called rakugo. This
          is a kind of one-man storytelling theater. The main thing in such
          stories is the subtext that causes laughter among the local public,
          and sometimes foreigners can be confused.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Humor in Italy</p>
        <p>
          Many people know that Italians have a great sense of humor, but not
          everyone knows about their contribution to the development of modern
          comic genres. Meanwhile, it was in Italy that the foundations of
          &quot;stand up&quot; were laid. Today, Italians are ready to joke
          about anything except the family. Most often, their humor is directed
          at themselves, politicians and neighbors from other regions.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I deliberately took two countries with rather different points of view on
      humor. Below I will tell you a little about the different types of humor
      that i realy like.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        &quot;Puns&quot; are a kind of humor that is present in one way or
        another in all countries. The essence of a pun is a word combination
        containing a pun based on the use of words that sound the same, but
        differ in meaning or have different meanings of the same word. For
        example: - How can food upset you? - If this is a funeral meal. The word
        &quot;mourning&quot; there sounds almost like &quot;morning&quot;. So
        easy and fun!
      </li>
      <li>
        Self-irony is irony directed against oneself. In self-irony, negative
        statements can have the opposite (positive) connotation. On example:
        &quot;Laughing at yourself is easier, but not better&quot;.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="about-city">About City</h2>
    <p>
      I recently watched a
      <a href="https://youtu.be/Gb0TQ7VeApY">YouTube</a> video about Japan and
      it really amazed me! After that I definitely want to visit the capital of
      Japan - Tokyo. In general, everything that I will tell about the city
      applies not only to it but to the whole country. The Japanese are very
      avid dandies. There are a lot of expensive boutiques in the city.Of
      course, all global brands are represented here. Twice in modern history,
      the metropolis remained in ruins: first during the Great Kantian
      earthquake of 1923, and then after large-scale firefighting during the
      Second World War. Because of this, the modern cityscape of Tokyo is mostly
      modern architecture. The culture and mentality of the Japanese was greatly
      influenced by the isolated territorial position of the country,
      geographical and climatic features, as well as special natural phenomena
      (frequent earthquakes and typhoons), which was expressed in the peculiar
      attitude of the Japanese towards nature as a living creature. The Japanese
      appreciate nature and are able to admire her beauty. Also, the Japanese
      are very fond of animals. The infrastructure of pets is very developed.
      There are even hotels for cats and dogs, wow, really interesting!
    </p>
    <p>
      I can tell a lot more about Tokyo, but it's better to see it all once than
      hear it.

    <p>
      From childhood I was very exited by exact sciences, especially mathematics
      and physics. At school, I tried my best in these disciplines to get into a
      good university. Due to my good studies at the University, I was invited
      to work at the Department of Control Theory and System Dynamics, there my
      supervisor and I wrote a few good science articles. But at the same time,
      I have always been attracted to Web development. It attracted me because
      most of the services that we use every day work through the Internet and I
      always wanted to understand how it works. Moreover, in the modern world,
      it's more reasonable to make a Web application, because it's initially
      cross-platform, you do not need to download and install app, just click on
      the link, it's very convenient. Even this homework I did using my
      knowledge in web development! Well. I really like it and I spent a lot of
      time creating some of my own projects, understanding existing web
      technologies.

        >Here</a
      >
      is an example of one of my projects dedicated to the study of differential
      equations. In the middle of my 4th year at university, I applied for a job
      at an foreign web development company and my application was accepted.
      Currently, i'm engaged backend development for several projects, which is
      just great! Recently we launched a
      <a href="https://ommiebird.com/">new social network</a>, on which my
      colleagues and i have been working for a long time. I would like to note
      the fact that the knowledge obtained at the university is practically not
      useful to me in my work, but because of the university I have learned how
      to study effectively. This skill is useful in any job, especially in the
      information technologies.
    </p>
    <h2 id="page-25-about-job">Exercise 7. Page 21. Planning a trip</h2>
    <p>
      I would like to visit
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBJyaIR1mlw">iceland</a> because
      the nature is very beautiful there. Iceland is an island nation in the
      North Atlantic Ocean. I would like to taste all national dishes. Why not?)
      An interesting fact is that the national cuisine there mostly includes of
      seafood, this is due to the fact that the entire island is surrounded by
      water. In order to travel in Iceland, you don't need to plan a route in
      advance. All because you don't have to go far to enjoy the beauty of
      nature. But there are some interesting natural sites that are definitely
      worth a visit - these are the
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wb84vvYSPEU&t=2092s"
        >"black beach"</a
      >
      and the
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wb84vvYSPEU&t=2213s"
        >"glacial lagoon"</a
      >. And yet, I think it would be most convenient to rent a car. There are
      many beautiful places and little time. Also, an interesting natural site
      is the "Faroe Islands". it's an archipelago of 18 islands. The population
      of the Faroe Islands is only 50 thousand people. Interesting fact about
      the Faroe Islands - houses with grass on the roof. That's very beautiful.
      Several Yet. There are no trees here, and there are twice as many sheep as
      people. In general. Iceland is a very beautiful country that I would like
      to visit.
    </p>

    <h1 id="2st">2 semester</h1>
    <h2 id="about_money">Money</h2>
    <p>
      In the modern world, there is nowhere without money. Money has long become
      an integral part of our life. Everyone earns in their own way.
      Undoubtedly, everyone's wealth is different. But you can earn a lot and
      still have nothing. Also, on the contrary, you can earn little, but at the
      same time manage your finances competently. Few people know how to do
      this. There are quite a few poor people in our country. Sometimes they
      even stand on the street and ask for money. Most often they are old people
      or gypsies. And if the second should be advised to find a job, the first,
      of course, must be helped. But the best help I can find is grocery
      shopping. This way we can understand that our money will not be spent on
      buying alcohol or something like that. Besides, you can give money to
      street musicians. After all, they spend their time and energy to please
      other people. Playing musical instruments or singing is work. As for me, I
      play the guitar myself and if I have cash in my pocket, I always give a
      small part of this money to street musicians.
    </p>

    <h2 id="unlucky_situation">Unlucky situation</h2>
    <p>
      What about unfortunate situations? They usually happen when you don't
      expect them at all. It can be morning, afternoon, or evening. You can be
      in a good mood, but only one accident can ruin all day. Even after a long
      time, an unpleasant residue may remain. But, as a rule, people don't
      remember small failures. it's as if the brain itself tries to erase from
      memory all the bad things that happen. Perhaps this is a defensive
      reaction. But what to do when major failure and troubles occur. it's
      unlikely that we will ever forget them. Obviously, in a couple of years we
      will think of them as something of the past, long gone. And this is what
      usually helps me deal with it. One more thing, if you learn to look at
      yourself from the outside, it helps to correctly assess the situation and
      worry less.
    </p>

    <h2 id="memorable_journey">Memorable Journey</h2>
    <p>
      What about Memorable Journey? This happened a few years ago. And like all
      memorable Journey it begins as a normal trip. My friends and i planned
      that we would go to the river, swim and fry kebabs. And that's actually
      what happened, but it was something we didn't plan for. We took a ride on
      air mattresses on a very fast current, where there were a lot of rocks,
      and it was quite dangerous, but at the same time very fun. May be that
      moment made this trip so memorable, i guess. But in all other respects, it
      was a normal trip, just everyone was in a good mood, favorite friends were
      nearby and everything went very well. Of course, we had some expenses for
      gas and food. But it was all inexpensive. it's also worth mentioning that
      we spent the night in a tent and it was very cold. This is the only
      trouble that happened to us. At about 5 am we cleaned everything up and
      drove back to the city. That's all.
    </p>
  </body>

  <h2 id="major_event">Major event</h2>
  <p>
    My main idea is that the main event in our country is the absence of such an
    event. Let me explain that. My whole story will be about politics and about
    the life of the last 20 years in Russia. So let's start. And as I know, our
    country has rich natural resources, for example oil, which we are pumping
    all this time. And until 2012-2013, it seems to me that the people of our
    multinational country were getting richer, but then something went wrong,
    and for now, we are where we are, our teachers and doctors receive very
    little money, and if I think about it too long, it makes me depressed. Our
    officials have many palaces and live a luxurious life. So I don't like what
    is happening now. The most talented people leave Russia, for example, the
    Durov brothers, who created VKontakte and telegrams. Once upon a time there
    was no such thing, but it was just the opposite. For example, the famous
    scientist
    <a
      href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%AD%D0%B9%D0%BB%D0%B5%D1%80,_%D0%9B%D0%B5%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B4"
      >Euler</a
    >
    moved to Russia in 1727 at the invitation of Catherine I. And it was in
    Russia that Euler created his most powerful scientific works. This can not
    but rejoice. But now it's not like that. We have had the same president for
    20 years, no one has believed the judges and the media for a long time. To
    be honest, it's very bad, but I hope that the situation will change.
  </p>
  <h2 id="tourist">Tourist authority</h2>
  <p>
    Pervomaisk is a small city with a population of 15 thousand people, the city
    itself is surrounded by forest, so this can make a good tourist destination,
    such as Bolshoe Boldino. Bolshoe Boldino and the surrounding land for four
    centuries belonged to the Pushkin family-one of the oldest noble families in
    Russia. Since May Day history is not rich in such famous personalities, I
    think that we should develop the touristic infrastructure. In general, now
    there are quite a lot of various parks in the city, which has a positive
    effect on the improvement of the city. It would be great to make several
    recreation centers on the border of the city, next to small rivers. Of
    course, in the modern world, marketing and advertising play a very important
    role in the dissemination of information, so this is also worth focusing on.
    Thus, I believe that Pervomaisk has a great chance of developing a good
    tourist infrastructure. But at the moment, Pervomaisk remains a purely
    industrial city.
  </p>

  <h2 id="crime_story">Crime story</h2>
  <p>
    This story happened to me when I was about 8 years old. I came to the
    village with my parents for a few days. One of these days I was sent to the
    store to buy bread. I ride my bike up to the store and in front of it I am
    met by 2 big village guys who apparently wanted to have fun. They told me to
    buy cigarettes at the store. Some time later that I realized they were just
    joking, but at that moment I took their words seriously. So, I went to the
    store and asked the seller to sell me cigarettes, he of course said no. But
    I said that my dad asked me to buy him cigarettes. The seller knew my
    father, and he believed me. Then I went out of the store and shouted to the
    two guys that I had bought them cigarettes. They were very surprised at
    this, laughed at me and left. I thought that nothing terrible had happened
    and went home, but on the way I was met by 2 village boys who put sticks in
    my wheels, which prevented me from driving further. I decided that if I gave
    them the cigarettes, they would leave me alone, and that's what happened. I
    don't know what else I could have done to get them off my back. Such a funny
    sequence of events happened to me.
  </p>

  <h2 id="stress">About stress</h2>
  <p>
    What is stress? I think most often it's some kind of emotional burnout. That
    happened to us when we have some bad emotions. But few people know that
    stress can also be caused by strong positive impressions. For example, when
    we dream about something good for a long time, it's also a certain load on
    our brain, which in the long run can also lead to stress. Everything is good
    in moderation. Usually, stress occurs when you try to do something, and you
    fail. There can be another reason. This is when you try to help everyone,
    listen to their problems, but you are too closed to turn to someone for
    help, or you don’t want to bother anyone. Obviously, stress builds up
    resistance to stress. Programmers call it "recoursion". And as a result, a
    person becomes more resistant to any twists and turns of fate. But not
    always a person can cope with this on his own. And for such situations i
    have a special person - a psychologist. I know that in Russia it's not
    customary to go to psychologists and I also don't see anything shameful in
    the fact that you understand your problems with a competent person. Problems
    should be solved by people who can solve them. If you can't solve some
    problem on your own, you need someone help to you. You also find peace with
    him. After therapy, you are saner, you look at things with a positive
    attitude. Also, personally for me,one more good way to be less stressed is
    listen music that i like. Music is very powerfull thing for me.

  <h2 id="get_used_to">What did you have to get used to?</h2>
  <p>
    First time in the camp.
    <br />
    According to the stories of my friends, this always happens. The first days
    in the camp seem very strange to you and it's not clear how to establish
    contact with the guys at all, because they are all unoccupied for you. And
    in fact, I never got into exactly this situation, because usually my friends
    and my brother always went to the camp with me. At the same time, I always
    tried to get to know as many people as possible. I still like people in
    general, I try to see only the good in them and try to pay less attention to
    the bad. Often I have seen a picture of how some people are afraid to
    communicate, and they definitely want it, but it looks quite the opposite.
    Here it's worth understanding that all people are different and everyone
    needs their own specific approach. To sum up, my inner culture, curiosity,
    and character structure have always helped me find a common language with
    people I don't know.

  <h2 id="aminals">About Zebra</h2>
  <p>
    The zebra belongs to the horse family. Its distinctive features are unique
    black stripes, like fingerprints on people. One of nature's greatest
    mysteries is why zebras have stripes. One theory is that the stripes help
    the zebra cool down. However, this is just a theory.
    <br />
    Burchell's Zebra stands 45 to 55 inches at the shoulder and weighs between
    480 and 555 pounds.
    <br />
    Grevy's Zebra stands 50 to 60 inches at the shoulder and weighs between 775
    and 995 pounds.
    <br />
    About distribution. The zebra is just nice to see in the wild, because it's
    one of the most commonly seen species in South Africa. They can also be
    found at the Addo Elephant National Park, Bontebok National Park, and the
    Botlierskop Game Reserve, which is just 25 minutes inland of Mossel Bay on
    the Garden Route.
    <br />
    About food ration. Zebra are herbivores. Both Burchell's and Grevy's zebras
    are looking for green pastures. In the dry season, they can live on dry
    grass only if they are close to water bodies. As it's not surprising, but
    zebras live in herds. Females are attached to their offspring, while males
    are attached to their territory. There is little dominance in the herd,
    except for the mating rights that the male may exercise over the female.

  <h2 id="L34|10">Paragraph 34, № 10</h2>
  <p>
    Let's talk about the factors that affect my mood. I think I feel better on
    weekends because I have more time to hang out with friends or do something
    that I have been put ting off for a long time. But not always I feel better
    in the weekends, there are many weekdays when for example I close a deadline
    and feel good. The weather affects my mood one hundred percent. This is
    absolutely true, I feel myself much better on sunny days.I love the sun. But
    in general, if you think about it, how, for example, the presence or absence
    of condensed water vapor (clouds) can affect your mood? But it does have an
    affect my mood &#x1F60a; I recently tried snowboarding, and so I can say the
    winter is not so boring now. In addition, getting to know people has a very
    positive effect on my mood, I like people in general. I try to see only the
    good in them and try to learn something new from everyone i know. Of course,
    music affects my mood. I love listening to music and I love creating it even
    more. It's really cool when you do it as a team. I've had this experience
    several times. For example, I was responsible for the music direction at the
    ITMM "Autumn debuts". It was a very cool experience. I think this has
    inspired me for many years ahead.
  </p>

  <h2 id="What_keeps_you_going">What keeps you going?</h2>
  <p>
    What keeps me going? This is a very simple question for me. The answer is
    people. After meeting interesting people, I feel a kind of extra energy that
    keeps me going. For example, I loved math because my first teacher was
    interested in it and tried to interest us. During the additional courses, I
    talked to many people and everyone was a very interesting person who
    inspired me to move forward. For example, I met a girl from Moscow who is
    studying at the HSE university. We went through a relatively new programming
    language together, which Google invented. So, one day I helped her with a
    rather difficult task. But then I was very surprised that at the end of the
    course, she completed many more tasks than I did, and in the end, her mark
    was excellent. It was really cool to know that I helped such a cool person.
    This gave me the strength to continue working. In fact, I've noticed a trend
    that many people don't enroll in a university master's program because they
    think it's a waste of time, or it won't affect their development. Of course,
    this may be true, but it's always easier to find negative points of view
    than positive ones. And I think that when you miss something, you choose the
    easiest way) I think the great way to learn how to do somthing very well is
    find other people who are already doing it, and work with them. It will
    definitely help you move on.
  </p>
  <h2 id="current_inventions">Describe, imagine your inventions</h2>
  <p>
    I've been doing music for quite some time. I have some idea of a gadget that
    doesn't exist yet. Since music theory is very important for understanding
    the structure of music, I think it would be great to facilitate the process
    of understanding this theory. When you learn music theory using a piano, I
    think it's a little easier, since all the musical intervals are very easily
    visible. On the guitar, it's harder. And that's where my invention can help.
    Imagine that on the neck of the guitar will be located some LED grid, which
    will be controlled from a smartphone. It will highlight the frets that will
    need to be clamped within a certain lesson. For example, imagine that we are
    learning the C major's gamma, and only the notes that belong to this gamma
    will be highlighted on the guitar neck. I think it would be very convenient
    and useful. For this device, I need programmers and electronics engineers.
    The first will be engaged in the development of the code, the second will be
    engaged in the development of the LED grid. Even if I don't have the
    resources to implement this idea, I think that over time someone else will
    be able to implement it, because the idea, I think, is quite simple.
  </p>

  <h2 id="7_8">
    Imagine you could set up any company you wanted. Talk about your ideas.
  </h2>
  <p>
    If I could create any company I want, I would create a company called "It
    music". I think this is great name, cause "it" - short for "information
    technology", and there is some cool ambiguity. I think my company would
    develop gadgets for musicians, like the
    <a href="#current_inventions">gadget</a> I described above. I've been
    interested in both music and information technology for quite some time, so
    I think I have every chance. My company's head office was located somewhere
    in the Netherlands. As far as I know, there are small taxes there, and at
    the same time, the head office of Yandex is located there. And Yandex is the
    thousands. How would we work together? I think

    methodology will be very helpful for us. This is a fairly well-known

  <h2 id="look-on">Space travel is a waste of money</h2>
  <p>
    I believe that space travel is not waste of money.
    <!-- 1 -->
    People have always been very curious about everything they see and what they
    don't see.
    <!-- 2 -->
    This is important one.
    <!-- 3 -->
    If we weren't interested in space, we wouldn't have some of the important
    technologies that we use now.
    <!-- 4 -->
    Let's list some of them.
    <!-- 5 -->
    Satellite TV, Internet, GPS system, thanks to which navigation and building
    routes from point A to point B work.
    <!-- 6 -->
    Also, a very interesting technology is being developed now, which would be
    impossible without traveling into space.
    <!-- 7 -->
    "Starlink" is a global satellite system deployed by SpaceX to provide
    high-speed broadband Internet access in places where it was unreliable,
    expensive or completely inaccessible.
    <!-- 8 -->
    it's worth noting that space travel is very expensive, but recently there
    has been a technological breakthrough that will significantly reduce the
    cost of space flights.
    <!-- 9 -->
    So the Falcon 9 rocket consists of two stages, one of which can be reused.
    Previously, this one was only possible in science fiction, but now it's a
    reality.
    <!-- 10 -->
    <br />
    People have always been burdened by space in general.
    <!-- 11 -->
    Once upon a time, people did not understand how our planet works and thought
    that the earth was flat, until scientists in the 6th century began to refute
    this theory.
    <!-- 12 -->
    Since that time, astronomy, like other sciences, has developed
    significantly.
    <!-- 13 -->
    Now we know a lot about space thanks to space travel, but a lot remains
    unknown.
    <!-- 14 -->
    Understanding how the space works helps us to understand and improve the
    world we live.
    <!-- 15 -->
    That's why I believe that pace travel is not waste of money 😊

    It was an ordinary unremarkable day.
    <!-- 1 -->
    He was my target.
    <!-- 2 -->
    I had to steal his money.
    <!-- 3 -->
    This man was not to blame for the fact that he was my target, it just
    happened.
    <!-- 4 -->
    I clearly remember the day I started doing this.
    <!-- 5 -->
    I was about 14 years old, then my favorite bike was stolen from me.
    <!-- 6 -->
    At that moment I thought that the world was unfair, but later I realized
    that there was nothing wrong with it.
    <!-- 7 -->
    After all, if you could steal someone's thing, then it rightfully becomes
    yours.
    <!-- 8 -->
    Many years have passed since then and my rates have increased.
    <!-- 9 -->
    This time I wanted to steal all that guy's money that he took to the bank.
    <!-- 10 -->
    According to my calculations, he should have had about 10 million in cash.
    Give or take.
    <!-- 11 -->
    I knew what he looked like. The most difficult thing was to attack him
    before the police arrived, who were already rushing to detain him.
    <!-- 12 -->
    These tricks are my doing.
    <!-- 13 -->
    Maybe when I get caught, I'll tell you about it.
    <!-- 14 -->
    But so far as we say, "Not caught, not a thief" 😈
    <!-- 15 -->

  <h2 id="rules-at-work">Rules at work</h2>
  <p>
    I work as a fullstack web programmer.
    <!-- 1 -->
    That's why I submit my homework in this format (like website 😊). I think
    it's convenient.
    <!-- 2 -->
    There are several rules at my job that must be followed.
    <!-- 3 -->
    Let me explain them.
    <!-- 4 -->
    <li>
      Be nice to customers.
      <!-- 5 -->
      This one very important rule.
      <!-- 6 -->
      We often have to communicate with clients and it's necessary to be able to
      explain complex things in simple words.
      <!-- 7 -->

      <!-- 8 -->
    </li>
    <li>
      Helping your colleagues.
      <!-- 9 -->
      Web technologies are developing very quickly, while different people have
      different learning abilities.
      <!-- 10 -->
      It's absolutely normal not to know or understand how some technologies
      work.
      <!-- 11 -->
      Therefore, it's important to help your colleagues understand new
      technologies.
      <!-- 12 -->
    </li>
    <li>
      Keep the deadline.
      <!-- 13 -->
      This is also very important.
      <!-- 14 -->
      In order not to break this rule, you first need to understand how long
      this part of the work will take, second you need to be able to
      productively communicate with your colleagues, because you work in a team
      and your work depends not only on you.
    </li>
    <!-- 15 -->
    I believe these three rules are the most important in my work 😊.
  </p>

  <p>Just a nice cat :)</p>

  <h2 id="missed-opportunity">Missed opportunity</h2>
  <p>
    Each person had an opportunity that he missed.
    <!-- 1 -->
    Now I will tell you about my missed opportunity 😞
    <!-- 2 -->
    At the end of high school, I actively played football. 
    <!-- 3 -->
    My team and I have successfully participated in various tournaments and competitions.
    <!-- 4 -->
    One of the seasons turned out to be particularly successful.
    <!-- 5 -->
    We won the championship of the Nizhny Novgorod region in mini-football,
    thanks to which we were invited to play in the 
    Russian championship among the teams of the Volga Federal District.
    <!--  6 -->
    This one very a very famous competition and we were very happy.
    <!--  7 -->
    But there were about 16 strong teams ahead of us and we had 
    to get ready for a serious game.
    <!--  8 -->
    We played quite successfully throughout the competition,
    thanks to which we were able to reach the final.
    <!--  9 -->
    We had to play with the Orenburg team.
    <!--  10 -->
    The game was very tense, the score was 1:1 and
    the second half time was coming to an end.
    <!--  11 -->
    I had the perfect pass
    and I just needed to roll the ball into the goal.
    <!--  12 -->
    It really was a simple moment.
    <!--  13 -->
    In training, we worked out much more difficult moments.
    <!--  14 -->
    I do not know why, but I missed and did not score a goal.
    <!--  15 -->
    That match we lose on penalties.
    I really think that moment was my missed opportunity.
  </p>

  <h2 id="politeness">Politeness</h2>
  <p>
    <!--  1 -->
    In general, few people are actually able to apologize for their actions.
    <!--  2 -->
    But I think this is a very important quality.
    <!--  2 -->
    I really like people who are able to honestly admit their guilt and apologize.
    <!--  1 -->
    There was one funny case when I had to apologize.
    <!--  2 -->
    I was about 7 years old.
    <!--  3 -->
    I just recently learned to ride a bike and therefore still did not ride well.
    <!--  4 -->
    That day my parents decided to go to the village.
    <!--  5 -->
    We don't have a garage there, so the car
    was next to the house.
    <!--  6 -->
    The car was in perfect condition, (at least before the incident 😂)
    because my father took care of her.
    <!--  7 -->
    And that day I was riding my bike and lost my balance.
    I had to fall off my bike, while the bike flew in one
    direction and I in the other.
    <!--  7 -->
    Of course, the bike got right into the car and
    left a quite noticeable dent there.
    <!--  8 -->
    The father was very angry when he saw this and
    I felt guilty about this incident.
    <!--  9 -->
    Of course, I had to apologize for it for quite a long time.
    <!--  10 -->
    But I learned a lesson from it.
    <!--  11 -->
    You need to try to anticipate situations in which
    everything can go out of control and be especially
    careful in them.
    <!--  12 -->
    Well, or try not to get into such situations at all 😊
